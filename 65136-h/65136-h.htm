<p>Dr. Johnson’s sturdy self-respect led him to invent the
Bookseller as a substitute for the Patron. My relations
with you have enabled me to discover how pleasantly the
Friend may replace the Bookseller. Let me record my sense
of many thoughtful services by associating your name with
a poem which owes its appearance in this form to your
partiality.</p>

<span class="i0">Days that seem farther off than Homer’s now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet the child had loudened to the boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, recluse from playmates, found perforce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Companionship in things that not denied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor granted wholly; as is Nature’s wont,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, safe in uncontaminate reserve,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ere life grow noisy, and slower-footed thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can overtake the rapture of the sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thrust between ourselves and what we feel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have something in them secretly divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vainly the eye, once schooled to serve the brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pains deliberate studies to renew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ideal vision: second-thoughts are prose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For beauty’s acme hath a term as brief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the wave’s poise before it break in pearl.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our own breath dims the mirror of the sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking too long and closely: at a flash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We snatch the essential grace of meaning out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that first passion beggars all behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heirs of a tamer transport prepossessed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, seeing once, has truly seen again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gray vague of unsympathizing sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dragged his Fancy from her moorings back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shores inhospitable of eldest time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet, by some subtler touch of sympathy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These primal apprehensions, dimly stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perplex the eye with pictures from within.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This hath made poets dream of lives foregone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In worlds fantastical, more fair than ours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Memory cheats us, glimpsing half-revealed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even as I write she tries her wonted spell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that continuous redbreast boding rain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bird I hear sings not from yonder elm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the flown ecstasy my childhood heard<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The fleeting relish at sensation’s brim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had in it the best ferment of the wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One spring I knew as never any since:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All night the surges of the warm southwest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boomed intermittent through the shuddering elms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brought a morning from the Gulf adrift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Omnipotent with sunshine, whose quick charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Startled with crocuses the sullen turf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wiled the bluebird to his whiff of song:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One summer hour abides, what time I perched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dappled with noonday, under simmering leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pulled the pulpy oxhearts, while aloof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An oriole clattered and the robins shrilled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Denouncing me an alien and a thief:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One morn of autumn lords it o’er the rest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in the lane I watched the ash-leaves fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balancing softly earthward without wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or twirling with directer impulse down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On those fallen yesterday, now barbed with frost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I grew pensive with the pensive year:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once I learned how marvellous winter was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When past the fence-rails, downy-gray with rime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I creaked adventurous o’er the spangled crust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That made familiar fields seem far and strange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As those stark wastes that whiten endlessly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ghastly solitude about the pole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gleam relentless to the unsetting sun:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instant the candid chambers of my brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were painted with these sovran images;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And later visions seem but copies pale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From those unfading frescos of the past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I, young savage, in my age of flint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazed at, and dimly felt a power in me<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parted from Nature by the joy in her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That doubtfully revealed me to myself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforward I must stand outside the gate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And paradise was paradise the more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Known once and barred against satiety.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What we call Nature, all outside ourselves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is but our own conceit of what we see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our own reaction upon what we feel;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world’s a woman to our shifting mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeling with us, or making due pretence;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore we the more persuade ourselves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make all things our thought’s confederates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conniving with us in whate’er we dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So when our Fancy seeks analogies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though she have hidden what she after finds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She loves to cheat herself with feigned surprise.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The rapture of its life made visible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mystery of its yearning realized,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the first babe to the first woman born;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No falcon ever felt delight of wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when, an eyas, from the stolid cliff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loosing himself, he followed his high heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To swim on sunshine, masterless as wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I believe the brown earth takes delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the new snow-drop looking back at her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think that by some vernal alchemy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It could transmute her darkness into pearl;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is the buxom peony after that,<br /></span>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
